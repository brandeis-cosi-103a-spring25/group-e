We constructed a game based on the card game Dominion. Our implementation is not a direct copy of the game, and has entirely new card names, but the basic rules can be found [here](https://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Gameplay) This is a two player game, and can be played with any combination of human or AI players. All AI players employ different strategies, with increasing difficulty from Random Buy, then Big Money, and finaly Smart Action. To play, simply input the player type, and then make all of the purchasing and playing choices. If only AI players are chosen, then you can just choose the player types and then watch the results!
